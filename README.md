SmartDict
=========

A suite consisted of a Chrome extension and an iOS app aiming at effectively learning English words via surfing the abundant web.

This is the Chrome extension part.

How to use?
===========

Press `ctrl + command + h` to hightlight all words from word database for current page, however even without that querying and highlighting one word is still supported, just press `alt` and double click one word to add it into word database.

Deleting words is available with the extension popup.
